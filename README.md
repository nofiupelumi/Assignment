# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python program generates a Fibonacci sequence based on a positive integer provided by the user.

## Description

The program defines a function, `fibonacci_sequence(n)`, that generates a Fibonacci sequence of length `n`. It checks for valid input, handles base cases, and calculates the sequence. If the input is not a valid positive integer, the program provides an error message.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter a positive integer when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence of the specified length.

## Example

Here's an example of using the program:
Enter a positive integer for the Fibonacci sequence: 7
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
## Error Handling

If the user enters invalid input (not a positive integer), the program will display an error message:
 Enter a positive integer for the Fibonacci sequence: abc
Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
